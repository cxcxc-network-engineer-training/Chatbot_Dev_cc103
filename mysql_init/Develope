B	"AWS provides an on demand, scalable infrastructure. AWS EC2 allows the user to launch On-Demand instances. AWS does not provide a fixed MAC address to the instances launched in EC2-CLASSIC. If the instance is launched as a part of EC2-VPC, it can have an ENI which can have a fixed MAC. However, with EC2-CLASSIC, every time the instance is started or stopped it will have a new MAC address.|To get this MAC, the organization can run a script on boot which can fetch the instance metadata and get the MAC address from that instance metadata. Once the MAC is received, the organization can register that MAC with the software."	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AESDG-chapter-instancedata.html
93	A user is trying to share a video file with all his friends. Which of the below mentioned AWS services will be cheapest and easy to use?	(A)AWS S3	(B)AWS EC2	(C)AWS RRS	(D) AWS Glacier	C	"AWS RRS provides the same functionality as AWS S3, but at a cheaper rate. It is ideally suited for non mission critical applications. It provides less durability than S3, but is a cheaper option."	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingRRS.html||
94	A user has configured ELB. Which of the below mentioned protocols the user can configure for ELB health checks while setting up ELB?	(A)All of the options	(B)TCP	(C)HTTPS	(D) SSL	A	"An ELB performs a health check on its instances to ensure that it diverts traffic only to healthy instances. The ELB can perform a health check on HTTP, HTTPS, TCP and SSL protocols."	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/Welcome.html||
95	A user is part of a group which has a policy allowing him just read only access to EC2. The user is part of another group which has full access to EC2. What happens when the user tries to launch an instance?	(A)It will allow the user to launch the instance	(B)It will fail since the user has just read only access	(C)It will allow or deny based on the group under which the user has logged into EC2 	(D)It will not allow the user to add to the conflicting groups	A	"The IAM group policy is always aggregated. In this case, if the user does not have permission for one group, but has permission for another group, he will have full access to EC2. Unless there is specific deny policy, the user will be able to access EC2."	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html
96	A user has launched an RDS instance. The user has created 3 databases on the same server. What can the maximum size be for each database?	(A)The size of each DB cannot be more than 3 TB	(B)It is not possible to have more than one DB on a single instance	(C)The total instance storage size cannot be more than 3 TB	(D)The size of each DB cannot be more than 1 TB	C	The AWS RDS DB instance is an isolated DB environment provided by AWS in which the user can create more than 1 database. The maximum size of the instance should be between 5 GB and 3 TB. The size of each DB can be anything in this range.	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html
97	A user has created an RDS instance with MySQL. The user is using the HeidiSQL client to connect with the RDS DB. The client is unable to connect to DB from his home machine. What is a possible reason for the failure?	(A)The user has to open port 80 in the RDS security group to connect with RDS DNS	(B)The security group is not configured to allow a request from the user’s IP on port 3306 	(C)You can never connect to RDS from your desktop	(D)The user has to open port 22 in the RDS security group to connect with RDS DNS	B	If the user needs to connect to RDS then he has to open port 3306 in the RDS security group for his IP address.	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Welcome.html
98	A user is creating a new EBS volume from an existing snapshot. The snapshot size shows 10 GB. Can the user create a volume of 30 GB from that snapshot?	(A)Provided the original volume has set the change size attribute to true	(B)Yes	(C)Provided the snapshot has the modify size attribute set as true	(D)No	B	A user can always create a new EBS volume of a higher size than the original snapshot size. The user cannot create a volume of a lower size. When the new volume is created the size in the instance will be shown as the original size. The user needs to change the size of the device with resize2fs or other OS specific commands.	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-expand-volume.html
99	An organization has 10000 employees. The organization wants to give restricted AWS access to each employee. How can the organization achieve this?	(A)Create an IAM user for each employee and make them a part of the group	(B)It is not recommended to support 10000 users with IAM	(C)Use STS and create the users’ run time	(D)Use Identity federation with SSO	D	"Identity federation enables users from an existing directory to access resources within your AWS account, making it easier to manage your users by maintaining their identities in a single place. In this case, the federated user is the only solution since AWS does not allow creating more than 5000 IAM users."	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/LimitationsOnEntities.html
100	Can a user associate and use his own DNS with ELB instead of the DNS provided by AWS ELB?	"(A)Yes, by creating a CNAME with the existing domain name provider"	"(B)Yes, by configuring DNS in the AWS Console"	(C)No	"(D) Yes, only through Route 53 by mapping ELB and DNS"	A	The AWS ELB allows mapping a custom domain name with ELB. The user can map ELB with DNS in two ways: 1) By creating CNAME with the existing domain name service provider or 2) By creating a record with Route 53.	http://docs.aws.amazon.com/ElasticLoadBalancing/latest/DeveloperGuide/using-domain-names-with-elb.
